# socialNetwork

## Description

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. It uses moment.js for date formatting.

## Experience

This assignment was very helpful and helped me understand how Mongoose works. I think the techBlog challenge really prepared me for this one, and it went a lot smoother than the techBlog went.

I used some of the code we worked on during class, specially from the mini-project. We also worked on this during office hours.
